The project investigates the Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Requests (VRPSR). The performance of a number of heuristic and simulation based models are examined for the problem. The most effective is a Grid-Based Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm. 

The original problem formulation is based on [Ulmer M.W. (2017) Anticipation in Dynamic Vehicle Routing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325372734_Anticipation_in_Dynamic_Vehicle_Routing). 

Below are two visualisations of the problem. The first is a myopic solver as it adds points and reroutes over the course of the problem. The second is a visualisation of generated grid-based distributions.
